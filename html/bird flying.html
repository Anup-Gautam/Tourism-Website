			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take your natural experience in Nepal to a whole new level by going bird watching in Nepal. The country and specially the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve in the eastern Terai is a bird watcher’s paradise. More than 850 species of birds are found in Nepal, and a surprisingly a large number of these birds can be spotted in and around the Kathmandu Valley alone. The hills around the valley especially Nagarjun, Godavari and Phulchowki are popular bird watching areas and the Taudaha Lake on the way to Dakshinkali is fabulous for watching migratory water fowl during the winter months.

            In the higher Himalayan regions are found the raptors and birds of prey of which there are numerous species. The various national parks like Chitwan and Bardiya harbor a wide variety of birds. But Koshi Tappu has better sightings of an incredible variety of both resident and migratory birds that come from as far away as Siberia. Nepal’s national bird is the lophophorous, Impeyen Pheasant locally called Danphe which is found in the Himalayan region. Bird watching trips are organized by most resorts and are accompanied by experienced naturalists. <br><br><img src="../photos/bd1.jpg" height="20%" width="40%">
